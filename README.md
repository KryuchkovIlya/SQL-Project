# SQL-Project

We will work with a database that stores information about venture capital funds and investments in startup companies.
This diverse dataset contains information about the startup ecosystem: organizations, individuals, company news, funding rounds, acquisitions, and IPOs.

There are 11 tables that can be joined using unique IDs:
- acquisitions
- degrees
- funding_rounds
- funds
- investments
- ipos
- milestones
- objects
- offices
- people
- relationships

Venture capital funds are financial organizations that can afford high risk and invest in companies with an innovative business idea or developed new technology, i.e. startups.
The goal of venture capital funds is to make a significant profit in the future, which is many times the amount they spent on investing in the company. 
If the startup goes up in value, the venture fund may receive a share in the company or a fixed percentage of its revenue.
